# Epic 2 — Enrichment: F-09 — AI Summary Enrichment (Opt-In)

**Priority:** P1  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 0.2.0  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-19

---

## Description

Users who opt in to AI summaries get a one-sentence summary added to `text` and supported `file` items (PDF, markdown, plain text). The model runs entirely in the browser via WebLLM — no data leaves the device.

---

## Opt-in Flow

- AI summaries are disabled by default
- A settings toggle labelled "AI summaries (runs on device)" enables the feature
- On first enable, the user is shown a one-time confirmation dialog explaining the model download size (~2 GB) and that processing happens locally
- The user must confirm before the download begins
- Download progress is shown as a persistent indicator until the model is ready
- Once downloaded, the model is cached in the browser; subsequent launches do not re-download

---

## Enrichment Flow (once opted in and model ready)

- Triggered for every new item with `type: text` or `type: file` (PDF, `.md`, `.txt` only)
- A one-sentence summary is generated and written to `meta.summary`
- The block re-renders in place to show the summary in a muted style below the content
- Items captured before opt-in are not retroactively summarised in this epic
- After 3 failed generation attempts, `enrichmentStatus.ai` is set to `failed` with a retry affordance

## Supported File Types for Summarisation

| Type    | Condition                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`  | Always (if opted in)                                                      |
| `file`  | Only if `mimetype` is `application/pdf`, `text/markdown`, or `text/plain` |
| `image` | Never                                                                     |
| `url`   | Never — URL track handles this separately                                 |

## Acceptance Criteria

- AI summaries toggle is off by default
- Enabling the toggle shows a confirmation dialog with download size (~2 GB) and on-device processing disclosure
- Declining the dialog leaves the toggle off and triggers no download
- Confirming the dialog starts the model download with a visible progress indicator
- After model is ready, new `text` items show a one-sentence summary below their content
- `raw` field is unchanged after summarisation
- Items captured before opt-in have no summary and show no empty placeholder
- Unsupported file types (zip, binary) are skipped silently — `enrichmentStatus.ai: 'skipped'`
- After 3 failed summary attempts → retry affordance shown on block

## Dependencies

- Epic 1 F-05 persistence schema
